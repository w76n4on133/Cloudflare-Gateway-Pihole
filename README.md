>> Added dynamic domain filter (whitelist and blacklist) idea (please check `ini` files, as you may also need to modify those).
>>> Added dynamic domain filter (whitelist and blacklist) to Actions variables (please check [dynamic_blacklist.txt](./lists/dynamic_blacklist.txt) and [dynamic_whitelist.txt](./lists/dynamic_whitelist.txt). to know examples to add `Value*`).Use `DYNAMIC_BLACKLIST` and `DYNAMIC_WHITELIST` for `Name*` in Actions variables 

### Supported styles
---
* Two kinds of lists in ini files: white list [whitelist.ini](./lists/whitelist.ini) and block list [adlist.ini](./lists/adlist.ini).

```ini
https://adguardteam.github.io/AdGuardSDNSFilter/Filters/filter.txt
```
or
```ini
[Ad-Urls]
Adguard = https://adguardteam.github.io/AdGuardSDNSFilter/Filters/filter.txt
```

### Custom URLs
---
* Add to file:
  > White list [whitelist.ini](./lists/whitelist.ini) and block list [adlist.ini](./lists/adlist.ini).

* Add to GitHub Action variables:
  > `Name*`
  >> `ADLIST_URLS` or `WHITELIST_URLS`.

  > `Value*` `URLs list`
  >> Example:
  ```text
  https://adguardteam.github.io/AdGuardSDNSFilter/Filters/filter.txt
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hagezi/dns-blocklists/main/wildcard/light-onlydomains.txt
  ```

* You should add your ad list and whitelist to Action variables. If you update your fork, your custom list will not be lost.

### How to set this up?
---
1. Fork this repository to your account.
2. Grab your **Cloudflare Account ID** (found after `https://dash.cloudflare.com/`) from ‚ûû https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/workers.
3. Create your **API Token** from ‚ûû https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens with 3 permissions:
   1. `Account.Zero Trust : Edit`
   2. `Account.Account Firewall Access Rules : Edit`
   3. `Account.Access: Apps and Policies : Edit`

4. Add **Repository Secrets** to your forked repository:
`‚ûû https://github.com/<username>/<forked-repository>/settings/secrets/actions`
   1. Set **Cloudflare Account ID** to `CF_IDENTIFIER`.
   2. Set **API Token** to `CF_API_TOKEN`.

### Schedule
---
> Due to a limited 2-month commitment from GitHub Actions, you can create and paste this code to run on Cloudflare Workers. Remember, GitHub Tokens generate with no expiration and all permissions.

```javascript
addEventListener('scheduled', event => {
  event.waitUntil(handleScheduledEvent());
});

async function handleScheduledEvent() {
  const GITHUB_TOKEN = 'YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN_HERE';
  try {
    const dispatchResponse = await fetch('https://api.github.com/repos/YOUR_USER_NAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME/actions/workflows/main.yml/dispatches', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${GITHUB_TOKEN}`,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0',
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        ref: 'main'
      }),
    });

    if (!dispatchResponse.ok) throw new Error('Failed to dispatch workflow');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error handling scheduled event:', error);
  }
}
```
>> Remember to set up Cloudflare Workers triggers.

### How to set up using Termux?
---

* Download the **GOAT** [Termux](https://github.com/termux/termux-app/releases/latest).

* Here are the `commands` that need to be run one after another to set up Python.

**If you know how to do this, you can skip this step.**
```sh
yes | pkg upgrade
yes | pkg install python-pip
yes | pkg install git
# Clone your forked repo. #
```

* Enter folder:

`cd <your forked name>`

* Edit `.env` (**required**):

```sh
nano .env
```

`CTRL + X + Y + ENTER` to save it.

* Install Dependencies:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

* Command to upload (update) your DNS list:

```sh
python -m src
```

### Note
---
* The **limit** of `Cloudflare Gateway Zero Trust` free is **300k domains**, so remember to pay attention to the workflow logs. If it is exceeded, the script will stop.

* If you have uploaded lists using another script, you should delete them using the delete feature of the uploaded script or delete them manually.

* I have updated the feature to delete lists when you no longer need to use the script. Go to [__main__.py](src/__main__.py) as follows:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    cloudflare_manager = CloudflareManager(PREFIX, MAX_LISTS, MAX_LIST_SIZE)
    # cloudflare_manager.run()
    cloudflare_manager.leave() # Leave script 
```

Note from [@minlaxz](https://github.com/minlaxz):
1. Domain list style: I personally preferred the second one in blacklist styles, which is more readable and concise.
2. Dynamic domain list: You can also update your dynamic (fluid) whitelist and blacklist using [dynamic_blacklist.txt](./lists/dynamic_blacklist.txt) and [dynamic_whitelist.txt](./lists/dynamic_whitelist.txt).
3. Deprecated using `.env`: Setting sensitive information inside a public repository is considered too dangerous, since any unwanted person could easily steal your Cloudflare credentials from that `.env` file.
